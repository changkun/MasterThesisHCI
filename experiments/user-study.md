## Measurement

1. There are six designed tasks, each task contains three major intent. The participant should be able to finish each task within 5 minutes (record finished/unfinished, **pilot study**). Finish same task with search engine again. 

   - Latin square erase learning effect --> User i: with search engine / without search engine; User i+1: without search engine / with search engine;

     ```
     User i            User i+1
     
     Task1 wSE       Task1 w/oSE
     Task2 wSE       Task2 w/oSE
     Task3 wSE         ...
     Task4 wSE
     Task5 wSE
     Task6 wSE
     ----------------------------
     Task1 w/oSE     Task1 wSE
     Task2 w/oSE     Task2 wSE
     Task3 w/oSE       ...
     Task4 w/oSE
     Task5 w/oSE
     Task6 w/oSE
     
     
     - do not do search engine
     - future work for search engine
     ```

      - Is there a learning effect? Is the second round of perform same task always better than first round?

   - Complete task without search engine / with search engine
     - How search engine influences the result? How much the search engine improve user clickstream? (length and time)
     - Does "with Search Engine" significantly improve user clickstream for all tasks? Which significant test should be used in this case? should based on the first question.
   - Task complete / Task incomplete
     - Is the task description too fuzzy and the user doesn't understand the task properly?
     - Where did the user end up?
     - How much user i clickstream differ from to the shortest clickstream that finished the task?
   - Clickstream of each task, hybrid sequence: action, time, action, time, ..., time, action;
     - Measuring `URLi -> URLj`, `Ti` for time stay on `URLi`;
     - Use the shortest clickstream as ground truth;

2. **Collection purpose**: Two tracks for the first study:

   - Offline group: 20 person

     - Finish 6 tasks, record all clickstreams
   - Online group: people who in offline group: Require all participants install the chrome browser plugin for 1 week (do not say restrict in 10min), measures every day at least 10min. --> **change point study? others??**
   - **Approaches**:

     - **Change point detection**: Hidden markov chain

     - **Productivity**: distance between two change point, shorter means productive; --> Use the shortest path from a participant, mark the path as ground truth. When analyse other user clickstream, compute the shortest path between Dijkstra

       ```
          +--- click k ---+
          |               v 
       click i -----> click j
       ```

     - URL embeddings: next possible click prediction ("network action sequence prediction")

3. **Evaluation** (with trained model), same tasks (PP: Plugin Prediction), two tracks:

   - Use nothing (vanilla, V), use search engine (SE), use plugin (P).

   - vanilla

   - vanilla + SE

   - vanilla + P

   - vanilla + SE + P

     ```

     - Same group of user in evaluation stage, install plugin with trained model. Use about one week, at lease 10min every day.

     - Metrics:

       - `#total_clicks`

       - `#plugin_clicks`

       - `len(clickstream_{ij})`

       - `dist(clickstream_{ij}, clickstream_{kj})`, `dist: manhattan distance`

       - `dist(clickstream_{ij}, clickstream'_{ij})`ï¼Œ`': wSE,w/oSE,V,P`

       - `t-test(clickstream_{i*}, clickstream'_{i*})`: compare two task groups, same user, 

         | Dependent Variable                        | Independent Variable | Control Variable |
         | ----------------------------------------- | -------------------- | ---------------- |
         | `User i`'s clickstream `clickstream_{i*}` | `Task j V`           | `w/oSE, wSE, P`  |

         Task specific? Best control conditions? Best: shortest clickstream

       - `t-test(clickstream_{*j}, clickstream'_{*j})`: compare  two user groups, same task, idependent variables: `user,wSE,w/oSE,V,P`

         | Dependent Variable                          | Independent Variable | Control Variable |
         | ------------------------------------------- | -------------------- | ---------------- |
         | `Task j V`'s clickstream `clickstream_{*j}` | `User i`             | `w/oSE, wSE, P`  |

         User specific? Best control conditions? Best: shortest clickstream

         - how changes the behavior / cyclers , measure changes havior when use the plugin, how they reflect the plugin. qualidative / think cloud / (super) equivelant task for same user. 

     - Method:
       - Accuracy - ratio of usage: `#click_plugin_provided_links / # total_clicks`
       - Optimization Rate: `len(clickstream_i)`
       - Similarity measurement: Pairwise `dist(clickstream_{i}, clickstream_{j})` matrix between participants: similarity between users. / same, similarity between tasks

## Questionnaire

1. General questions: age, study program/occupation, male/female, ...
2. What are the top-5 (max to 5, seen pattern) websites that you accessed most during the week? List all of them. (include private use): **indication for people different groups productive use group, compaire user groups** general indications both kind of use, kinf of indications.
3. Explain what is your purpose to acessing the website? For work/study or information browsering/amusing?
4. Do you have a clear purpose when you actually access your top-5 websites? For example, when you login to youtube, are you looking for a specific video or just browsing. Answer the question for all of your top-10 websites. **(two conditions, sometimes just browsing, sometimes looking for specific, motivations to go to the website, cook, just look cat video, both cases, report own, question, description situation why you use it, how, purpose? browsing behavior)**
5. When you use search engine, do you save the website of result to your bookmarks? Why?
6. Do you use browser plugin? What is your major browser? chrome/safari/ie or else?













Video / record participant / record desktop screen / for safety why user spend so much time

record mouse / record click / view / elements that user clicked



Argument: why we dont' record others? find things use







Wild study, pop up ask: "what are you doing?" are you productive, are you browsing for fun.





1. amazon task
2. pilot study
3. ask people in median group





```py
networkx
```



























**Note: **

- **Keep pages open if they are required in the task, close the irrelevant pages when you don't need it.**
- You are allowed to do anything, such as open multiple pages, use search engine and etc.
- Close the browser when you finished the task and accomplished the requirement
