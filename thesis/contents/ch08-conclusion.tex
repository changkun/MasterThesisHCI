% \subsection{Summary}

% 1. what has been done

This thesis proposes the action path model that describes client-side user clickstreams.
To justify the model, the thesis designed nine browsing tasks for three qualitatively
discussed types of browsing behavior based on the theory of information behavior. 
Then, a user study is held for these tasks that simulated those behaviors. 
Afterwards, the thesis applied the data collected from user study to the action path model and
analyzed the model performance for this data with comparisons to the traditional machine 
learning approach.
The thesis also provided the visualization of these data and discovered the common, 
individual, and intersection patterns among the client-side clickstream.
As an application showcase, a browser plugin was illustrated, which monitors client-side 
user clickstreams to predict future movements of web browsing. The benefits and drawbacks of 
this plugin was also discussed in the corresponding chapter.
Furthermore, a generic architecture communication flow, and the possibilities of 
standardization as browser Web APIs are presented for other developers.

% 2. what are the findings

The follows summarizes the answers to the research questions:

\paragraph{Understanding} 
(a) A client-side collected clickstream is different from the 
server-side collected clickstream because of parallel visiting 
and multiple website visiting. The three types of suggested browsing behaviors are
goal-oriented, fuzzy and exploring behaviors.
(b) The number of actions, total stay duration and completion efficiency cannot 
provide an accurate classifier for these three behaviors. However, 
the number of actions is more important than the others for indicating 
goal-oriented browsing behavior and the other two features are more important 
for indicating exploring behavior;
(c) The observed patterns in the action path, which include cluster, hesitation, ring, 
star and overlap contribute to different browsing behaviors;
(d) Action paths visually tend to be user-specific but remain common interests 
in goal-oriented behaviors.
\paragraph{Classification} the proposed action path model is 100\% accurate for 
the classification of the three types of browsing behavior, which is trained on a user-independent dataset.
\paragraph{Prediction} prediction of three to five future steps can be accurately (>60\%) predicted
in a simplest action path model.

% 3. emphasize the importance >> place to large context
The findings are generic. The model is an action-level model that models
a sequence of user actions and the time of decision making (stay duration). This means 
that it can be used on desktop, and also can be implemented in context of mobile devices, 
or even outside the context of web browsing.
Similar to other user behavior data, a client-side user clickstream or user actions 
directly indicate movements of a user and how they make decisions. Understanding, 
interpreting and predicting these data not only improves the user experience of
web browsing, but also useful to help users to reduce useless browsing, which 
manages their time more efficiently. Moreover, standardizing the data processing process 
can formalize this feature for developers, which will help them to use the behavior predictions to
improve the user experience of their products.

% 4. summarize / conclude
Traditional server collected clickstream data has proved its high value in many 
fields. This work exposit the value one-step forward, and contributes to models 
and approaches that hope to bring ponderable research to the community and industry.
