        \item[Problem Statement] Under standing user behavior helps designer optimize 
        their product user experiences. Meanwhile, users can benefit more productive 
        from it. Since user intents are elusive, changeable and sometimes even undetermined, 
        predict their behavior usually difficult and impoissible. In most cases, a user may 
        performs a series of wasted actions before reach an intent destination. 
        Nevertheless, user intents becomes clear step by step after performs a series of 
        actions in a given context. 
        \item[Scope of the Thesis] To tackle the aforementioned challenges, the objective of this thesis is to develop a system that tracking user actions within a website,

    I would like to appreciate Malin Eiband and Dr. Daniel Buschek for their great and 
    constructive discussion, suggestion around thesis topic selection, model statements,
    thesis structuring as well as their pacient of given supervision to the thesis. 
    The thesis would not be accomplished without them. Afterward, I am full of gratitude to 
    Prof. Hussmann and Prof. Butz for offering me an unexpected opportunity to study aboard in Germany 
    as well as their kindly helps regarding study and living in my academic period.
    Next, I wish to thank my best friend Yi, schoolfellow Yifei and Xingying, 
    and former colleague Jin for their inspiring discussions surrounding my thesis. 
    Finally, I will forever be beholden to my parents for their continuous supports 
    while my postgraduate study, since they dedicated their live to my better future.

\abstract{
    Early clickstream research emerges since the end of last century and 
    has proliferated in the heart of our Internet world.
    Trades, public opinions, and almost every traces are precisely recorded 
    on server side log files.
    The fundamental interaction between client and server stands immutably, 
    despite the fact that mobile devices have governed our daily life.
    In this thesis, we proposed a model to characterize user browsing behavior 
    while involving clickstream with multi-tab branching and backtrack actions on the Web, 
    and we call it Action Path model.
    To justify our model, we first established a lab study and collected clickstream data
    of individuals, consists of chronologic URLs and corresponding stay durations of each URL,
    with manually designed nine different web browsing task for three mainstream websites 
    based on the theory of information behavior.
    Each website has three types of tasks, including goal-oriented, fuzzy and 
    exploring browsing task, which characterized the corresponding three browsing 
    behaviors.
    By analyzing the subjects trace from our lab study, we seek to archive these goals:
    1) Understanding: identify if browsing behaviors are distinguishable and 
    finding common patterns that appears in client-side clickstreams from subjects.
    2) Classification: to separate and report browsing behaviors on the web, that help 
    users better understanding their status.
    3) Prediction: present the future click path more than one step with given context of
    browsing history in a session.
    To archive these goals, our quantitative analysis indicates that goal-oriented, fuzzy and exploring
    browsing behaviors are almost 100\% classifiable based on chronologic URLs, and the prediction
    performance of our model suggests higher than 60\% of accuracy for 3-5 steps of future clickstream prediction.
    Meanwhile, our qualitative analysis to the clickstream indicates 5 observed patterns, 
    including ``ring'',``star'', ``overlap'', ``hesitation'' and ``cluster'' patterns, which 
    represents the patterns of client-side clickstream. 
    As an illustration of application, we also developed a browser plugin that proactively serves users,
    as well as suggesting predictions of the possible future clicks to a user.
    Furthermore, a generalized design of our model and plugin communication protocol 
    are discussed for possibility of formalizing them as standard Web APIs to help designer and 
    developers to improve and monitor user experience of their products.
    To the best of our knowledge, this is the first such detailed study regarding web browsing 
    behavior modeling based on client-side clickstream.
