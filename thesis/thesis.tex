        % Under standing user behavior helps designer optimize

        % from it. Since user intents are elusive, changeable and sometimes even undetermined, 
        % predict their behavior usually difficult and impoissible. In most cases, a user may

        % Nevertheless, user intents becomes clear step by step after performs a series of 
        % actions in a given context. 
        \item[Scope of the Thesis] To be added
        % To tackle the aforementioned challenges, the objective of this thesis is to develop a system that tracking user actions within a website,

        \item[Tasks] (1) Conduct a literature review to identify research questions regarding
        clickstream research that are of interest to researchers and practitioners \\
        (2) Design a machine learning based model in clickstream modeling and 
        creating an appropriate experiment with theoretical support to justify model performance and its interpretability \\
        (3) Develop an web application as a demonstration of the model and evolving it as a generic architecture
        for the proposed model.
        \item[Requirements] Strong skills in mathematical modeling and machine learning approaches, independent scientific work and creative problem solving,

    I would like to appreciate Malin Eiband and Dr. Daniel Buschek for many of their great and 
    constructive discussions, suggestion around thesis topic selection, model statements,
    thesis structuring as well as their pacient of given supervision to the thesis. 
    The thesis would not be accomplished without them. Afterward, I am full of gratitude to 
    Prof. Hussmann and Prof. Butz for offering me an unexpected opportunity to study aboard in Germany 
    as well as their kindly helps regarding study and living in my academic period.
    Next, I wish to thank my best friend Yi, schoolfellow Yifei and Xingying, 
    and former colleague Jin for their inspiring discussions surrounding my thesis. 
    Finally, I will forever be beholden to my parents for their continuous supports 
    while my postgraduate study, since they dedicated their live to my better future.

\abstract{
Clickstream applications appeared at the end of last century and 
have proliferated at the heart of our Internet world.
Trades, public opinions, and almost every web requests are precisely recorded 
on server-side log files.
The fundamental interaction between a web service client and server stands immutably, 
even though mobile devices have governed our daily life.
In this thesis, we propose a machine learning model that characterizes user browsing behavior 
while including multi-tab branching and backtrack actions in a browser instead of
web request-based clickstreams. We call this model the Action Path model.
To justify our model, we established a lab study and collected individuals' clickstream data, 
which consisted of chronologic URLs and corresponding stay durations for each URL.
We designed nine different contexts given web browsing tasks for three mainstream websites 
based on the theory of information behavior.
Each website has three types of tasks: a goal-oriented task, fuzzy task and 
exploring browsing task. They characterize the corresponding three browsing 
behaviors.
We seek to achieve the following goals by analyzing the subject's trace from our lab study:
1) Understanding: identify if browsing behaviors are distinguishable and 
find common patterns that appear in an action path.
2) Classification: separate and report browsing behaviors on the web, which will help 
users to better understand their status.
3) Prediction: present the future click path in more than one step with the given context of
the browsing history in a session.
Our quantitative analysis indicates that goal-oriented, fuzzy, and exploring
browsing behaviors are classifiable with 100.00\% precision based on the combination of 
chronologic URLs and stay duration. 
The prediction performance of our model indicates higher than 60\% accuracy for 
three to five steps of future clickstream prediction.
Our qualitative analysis of the clickstream indicates five observed patterns, 
including ``ring'',``star'', ``overlap'', ``hesitation'' and ``cluster'' patterns, which 
represent the patterns of an action path. 
To illustrate the application, we also developed a browser plugin that proactively serves users,
and suggests predictions for the possible future user clicks.
Furthermore, we discuss a generalized design of our model and plugin communication protocol. 
This discussion explores the possibility of formalizing the model and protocol as standard 
Web APIs to help designers and developers to improve and monitor the user experience of their products.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first detailed study regarding web browsing 
behavior modeling based on clickstreams collected from the client side.
