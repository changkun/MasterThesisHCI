\abstract{
    Early clickstream research emerges since the end of last century and has proliferated in the heart of our Internet world. 
    Trades, public opinions, and almost every traces are precisely recorded on server side log files. 
    The fundamental interaction between client and server stands immutably, 
    despite the fact that mobile devices have governed our daily life.
    In this thesis, we first established a lab study and collected clickstream data of individuals with manually designed nine different web browsing task for three mainstream websites. 
    Each website has three types of tasks, including goal-oriented, fuzzy and exploring browsing task.
    A collected clickstream of a subject is consists of a timestamp based URL and the time duration of a single URL.
    Based on the type of data, we proposed a generic modern clickstream model to characterize client-side user behavior.
    By analyzing the subject traces from our lab study, we seek to archive these goals:
    1) Understanding: to extract the common patterns between subjects and optimize the visiting clickstream pattern for a new user.
    2) Prediction: with given client clickstream, present the future click path more than one step.
    3) Classification: to separate and report whether a user is exploring on the web.
    To archive these goals, we developed a browser plugin as a possible application that predicts the future possible
    click under a visiting session and provides a score that indicates the probability of exploring.
    Furthermore, we generalize the design of our model and plugin communication protocol and
    discussed the possibility of formalizing them as standard Web APIs.
    To the best of our knowledge, this is the first client-side user clickstream study.
