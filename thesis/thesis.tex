\abstract{
Clickstream applications appeared at the end of last century and 
have proliferated the heart of our Internet world.
Trades, public opinions, and almost every trace of web requests are precisely recorded 
on server-side log files.
The fundamental interaction between a web service client and server stands immutably, 
despite the fact that mobile devices have governed our daily life.
In this thesis, we propose a machine learning model that characterizes user browsing behavior 
while involving multi-tab branching and backtrack actions in a browser instead of
web request-based clickstreams. We call it the Action Path model.
To justify our model, we first established a lab study and collected individuals' clickstream data, 
which consisted of chronologic URLs and corresponding stay durations of each URL
with designed nine different contexts given web browsing tasks for three mainstream websites 
based on the theory of information behavior.
Each website has three types of tasks, including a goal-oriented task, fuzzy task and 
exploring browsing task. They characterize the corresponding three browsing 
behaviors.
By analyzing the subject's trace from our lab study, we seek to archive the following goals:
1) Understanding: identify if browsing behaviors are distinguishable and 
finding common patterns that appear in an action path.
2) Classification: to separate and report browsing behaviors on the web, which help 
users better understanding their status.
3) Prediction: present the future click path more than one step with the given context of
the browsing history in a session.
To achieve these goals, our quantitative analysis indicates that goal-oriented, fuzzy and exploring
browsing behaviors are classifiable with 100.00\% precision based on the combination of 
chronologic URLs and stay duration. 
The prediction performance of our model shows higher than 60\% accuracy for 
3 to 5 steps of future clickstream prediction.
Meanwhile, our qualitative analysis of the clickstream indicates 5 observed patterns, 
including ``ring'',``star'', ``overlap'', ``hesitation'' and ``cluster'' patterns, which 
represent the patterns of an action path. 
As an illustration of application, we also developed a browser plugin that proactively serves users,
as well as suggesting predictions of the possible future user clicks.
Furthermore, a generalized design of our model and plugin communication protocol 
are discussed for possibility of formalizing them as standard Web APIs to help designer and 
developers to improve and monitor the user experience of their products.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first such detailed study regarding web browsing 
behavior modeling based on client-side collected clickstreams.
