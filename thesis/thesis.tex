    I would like to appreciate Malin Eiband and Dr. Daniel Buschek for their great and constructive discussion, suggestion around thesis topic selection, model statements as well as their pacient of given guidance to the thesis. The thesis would not be accomplished without them. Afterward, I am full of gratitude to Prof. Hussmann and Prof. Butz for offering me an unexpected opportunity to study aboard in Germany as well as their kindly helps in my academic period. Next, I wish to thank my best friend Yi, schoolfellow Yifei and Xingying, and former colleague Jin for their inspiring discussion surrounding my thesis. Finally, I will forever be beholden to my parents for their continuous supports while my postgraduate study, they dedicated their live to my better future.

\abstract{
    Early clickstream research emerges since the end of last century and has proliferated in the heart of our Internet world.
    Trades, public opinions, and almost every traces are precisely recorded on server side log files.
    The fundamental interaction between client and server stands immutably, 
    despite the fact that mobile devices have governed our daily life.
    In this thesis, we proposed a model to characterize user browsing behavior while involving clickstream with multi-tab branching and backtrack actions on the Web, we call it Action Path model.
    To justify our model, we first established a lab study and collected clickstream data of individuals with manually designed nine different web browsing task 
    for three mainstream websites based on the theory of information seeking behavior.
    Each website has three types of tasks, including goal-oriented, fuzzy and exploring browsing task, which characterized the corresponding three browsing behaviors.
    A collected clickstream of a subject consists of a timestamp based URL and the time duration of a single URL.
    By analyzing the subjects trace from our lab study, we seek to archive these goals:
    1) Understanding: identify if browsing behaviors are distinguishable and finding common patterns that appears in clickstreams from subjects.
    2) Classification: to separate and report browsing behaviors on the web, that help 
    users better understanding their status.
    3) Prediction: present the future click path more than one step with given context of
    browsing history in a session.
    To archive these goals, beyond justification analysis, we also developed a browser plugin as a possible application that predicts the future possible
    click under a visiting session and provides a score that indicates the probability of exploring.
    Furthermore, we generalize the design of our model and plugin communication protocol 
    and discussed the possibility of formalizing them as standard Web APIs.
    To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study such detailed web browsing behavior modeling based on client-side clickstream.
